# A-Synthesis-of-Quantitative-Research-on-Programs-For-Struggling-Readers-in-Elementary-Schools
This repository provides open access to data analyzed in the AERA conference presentation, "Effective Tier 1 Reading Instruction for Elementary Schools: A Systematic Review".

## Abstract
There is an increasing demand for educators, policymakers, and researchers to understand evidence in education, particularly around important topics such as elementary reading, a building block for future development. This study builds upon existing reviews to generate a comprehensive and up-to-date review of programs addressing Tier 1 instruction in elementary reading, including all elementary grades, all students, and a specific focus on academic reading outcomes.

Schools have diverse approaches to choose from to provide instruction in elementary reading classrooms, but the effectiveness of these programs proved to be variable, even though all categories of programs had positive mean effect sizes. Schools should be encouraged to choose from proven programs to ensure all students have access to effective reading instruction.
